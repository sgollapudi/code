Hive Joining strategies

Hive converts join over more than two tables into a single join if the same set of keys are used for join over all tables.

As part of hive query if we try to join more than two tables, having different set of keys for join, then order of the tables in the join statement determine which two tables are joined first. Placing the table having maximum number of filters could improve the performance.
